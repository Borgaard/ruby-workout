# Ruby Class Lab
These problems will use your knowledge of classes. 

* Create a class called `SuperHero` that takes a `first_name` and `last_name`. Give each superHero a `super_punch` method that returns `"WHAM!"`.
* Create a class called `Robot` that takes `name` and `purpose`. Give each robot a `greet` method that returns `"beep boop"`

* Make a `Starship` class that takes a `model` and `owner_name`. 
  * Give your `Starship` a `set_top_speed` method and a `get_top_speed` method that let you change and read the `top_speed`. *Assume `top_speed` is just a number.*
  * Give your `Starship` an `accelerate_to` method that sets `current_speed` to some number, unless that number is greater than its `top_speed`.
* Make a `Dice` class that takes a `number_of_sides`. Add a method called `get_side` or `roll` that randomly returns a number from `1` up to the `number_of_sides`.
  * Modify your `get_side` method to record the returned side in a `last_roll` instance variable.
