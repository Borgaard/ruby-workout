# Ruby Class Lab

Create a class named `Person` with the following instance variables: 
- name
- age
- hometown

Also include the following logic inside of instance methods: 

- Normalize the names of a user's hometown. In other words, make the names consistent. For this lab, make all names of hometowns lowercase, regardless of a user's input. So "PHILADELPHIA", "Philadelphia", and "PHILAdelphia" should be normalized to "philadelphia". 

- Do not create an instance of a person if a name isn't provided as an argument during instance creation of_sides`.
